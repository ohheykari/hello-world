# hello-world
This is my first ever repository!
So, hey!  My name is Kari.  I live in St. Paul, with my husband and our two little kiddos.  About a year ago, I discovered my interest in learning programming, and after nearly 14 years as a glorified barista, I'd say its about time for a job makeover!  So far, I've learned HTML and CSS basics through the Treehouse website/school, and the more I learn, the more I want to add on to my 'To Learn' list!  I'm hoping to get familiar with PHP, Ruby, Java, C, and JavaScript, as well as expanding my current knowledge of HTML and CSS.  I'm excited to see where it takes me!
